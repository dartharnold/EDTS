On first run, the latest [EDSM](http://edsm.net)/[EDDB](http://eddb.io) system and station data must be downloaded, as well as [Coriolis](http://coriolis.io) data for ship FSD sizes:

`python update.py`  

These commands can be re-run at any time to refresh the data (for instance, if new data has been added to EDDB which is relevant to you).
